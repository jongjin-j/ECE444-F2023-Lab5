## Pros and Cons of TDD
Pros: Test-driven development increases code coverage, which reduces the risk of bugs and issues. The testing process is no longer rushed, hence a better quality of the product. Not only that, the development process becomes more efficient as there would be no need for the developers to manually test each code after implementation. This also affects the cost as the chance of bigger and more expensive bugs occurring would be much smaller as a result.

Cons: One disadvantage of TDD would be over-testing. Compared to the traditional testing method, TDD would force the developers to test the code a significant amount more, which leads to an increased development process period. The greater problem is that in practice, TDD is equivalent to writing test cases that do not work, or won't even compile in the first place.
